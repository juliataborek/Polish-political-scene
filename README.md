# Polish-political-scene
Polish political scene based on public opinion poll

Project implemented during master's studies, March 2024 - June 2024

**Main goal:** comparison of key politicians, finding the most important features that an ideal politician should represent and answering the question of which politician is closest to the ideal. Additionally, the intention was also to learn the opinions of respondents on the most important political and social issues and to examine the relationships between opinions on these topics and the characteristics of respondents.

**Poll:** The study was conducted on the basis of a questionnaire consisting of two parts. In the first part, respondents assessed the intensity of 15 traits in 8 main Polish politicians and defined their requirements for an ideal politician. 1 meant the lowest intensity of the trait, while 100 meant the highest. In the second part, respondents' opinions on various political and social issues in Poland were collected. The statements concerned various aspects of political life, such as politicians' salaries, their activities in the field of environmental protection, corruption, or social and moral issues, such as abortion or equalization of the retirement age. Respondents assessed each statement using a scale from 1 to 7, where 1 meant complete disagreement and 7 complete agreement with the given statement. In order to characterize individual groups, information on the age, gender, and education of the respondents was also collected.

**Includes:** preliminary analysis, cluster analysis, factor analysis and correspondence analysis

**Programs used:** RStudio, Statistica
